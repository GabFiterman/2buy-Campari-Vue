### üì¶ Downloading and Using the Application
Initially, it is important to establish that the project is private, as it may expose the security of LETT Digital.

Make sure you have Node.js installed - tested with v16.15.1

So to use the project, the first thing to do is clone it!
**`gh repo clone GabFiterman/2buy-Campari-Vue`**

In the project folder, it is important at this point to install its dependencies, which basically is the vue route scheme, the vite for deployment and visualization in development and the json-server, which will simulate the database.
**`npm install`**

With the dependencies installed you should already be able to access it, first it is essential to **start the data server** with
**`npm run database`**

So finally **start the dev Vite project**
**`npm run dev`**
